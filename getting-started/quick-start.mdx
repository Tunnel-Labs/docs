## Add the Tunnel Toolbar to your app
To enable Tunnel in your app, add the `<TunnelToolbar />` component to your app. For now, we have specialized SDKs for React and Next.js apps, but if you're using another framework, you can still use Tunnel by adding the `<script>` tag to your app.

## Deploy!
You're all set! Now you can start using Tunnel in your app. Deploy your app to a preview environment to see the Tunnel Toolbar in action.
