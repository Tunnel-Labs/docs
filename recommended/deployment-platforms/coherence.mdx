# What is Coherence?

[Coherence](https://withcoherence.com) provides automated environments for developing, testing, and deploying your app in the cloud. With a minimal yaml file, it spins up full-stack environments with automated build pipelines using cloud-native services.

## Why choose Coherence?

We recommend Coherence for the following reasons and use cases:
* Coherence 

# Using Tunnel with Coherence

Tunnel integrates seamlessly with [Coherence Branch Previews](https://docs.withcoherence.com/docs/overview/what-is-coherence) to enable built-in collaboration and feedback workflows for your team.

## Prerequisites

* Set up preview environments in Coherence. If you haven't already, follow the [Coherence Docs](https://docs.withcoherence.com/) to set up Coherence Branch Previews for your app.

## Add Tunnel to your app

You can add Tunnel to your Coherence Branch Previews using one of our [SDKS](/sdks) or for other frameworks, a simple `<script>` tag.

    ### Install the Tunnel React SDK

    <CodeGroup>
    ```shell npm
      npm install @tunnel/react
    ```

    ```shell yarn
      yarn add @tunnel/react
    ```

    ```shell pnpm
      pnpm add @tunnel/react
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ### Add the `<TunnelToolbar />` component to your app

    To enable Tunnel in your app, conditionally render the `<TunnelToolbar />` component in your app. Developers usually only render the `<TunnelToolbar />` component in your app when it is running in a Coherence Branch Preview environment.

    The `<TunnelToolbar />` component requires a `projectId` prop and a `branch` prop.

    - `projectId` is the ID of your Tunnel project. You can find your project ID in the [Tunnel Dashboard](https://tunnel.dev/redirect-to/default).
    - `branch` is the branch name of the Coherence Branch Preview. Coherence automatically injects the `COHERENCE_ENVIRONMENT_NAME` environment variable, which you can pass directly to the `<TunnelToolber />` component.

    ```jsx App.jsx
    import { TunnelToolbar } from '@tunnel/react';

    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          {(process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development" && process.env.COHERENCE_ENVIRONMENT_NAME !== "main") && (
            <TunnelToolbar
              projectId="PROJECT_ID"
              branch={process.env.COHERENCE_ENVIRONMENT_NAME}
            />
          )}
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

    ### Add the `<script>` tag to your app

    To enable Tunnel in your app, add the `<script>` tag to your app. Developers usually only add the `<script>` tag in your app when it is running in a Coherence Branch Preview environment.

    The `<script>` tag requires a `data-project-id` attribute and a `data-branch` attribute.

    - `data-project-id` is the ID of your Tunnel project. You can find your project ID in the [Tunnel Dashboard](https://tunnel.dev/).
    - `data-branch` is the branch name of the Coherence Branch Preview. Coherence automatically injects the `COHERENCE_ENVIRONMENT_NAME` environment variable, which you can pass directly to the `<script>` tag.

    ```html index.html
    <script
      src="https://tunnelapp.dev/__tunnel/script.js"
      data-project-id="PROJECT_ID"
      data-branch="COHERENCE_ENVIRONMENT_NAME"
    ></script>
    ```
