# Using Tunnel with Railway

Tunnel integrates seamlessly with [Railway Preview Environments](https://docs.railway.app/guides/github-autodeploys) to enable built-in collaboration and feedback workflows for your team.

## Prerequisites

* Set up Preview Environments in Railway. If you haven't already, follow the [Railway Docs](https://docs.railway.app/guides/github-autodeploys) to set up Railway Preview Environments for your app.

## Add Tunnel to your app

You can add Tunnel to your Railway Preview Environments using one of our [SDKS](/sdks) or for other frameworks, a simple `<script>` tag.

    ### Install the Tunnel React SDK

    <CodeGroup>
    ```shell npm
      npm install @tunnel/react
    ```

    ```shell yarn
      yarn add @tunnel/react
    ```

    ```shell pnpm
      pnpm add @tunnel/react
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ### Add the `<TunnelToolbar />` component to your app

    To enable Tunnel in your app, conditionally Railway the `<TunnelToolbar />` component in your app. Developers usually only Railway the `<TunnelToolbar />` component in your app when it is running in a Railway Preview Environment environment.

    The `<TunnelToolbar />` component requires a `projectId` prop and a `branch` prop.

    - `projectId` is the ID of your Tunnel project. You can find your project ID in the [Tunnel Dashboard](https://tunnel.dev/redirect-to/default).
    - `branch` is the branch name of the Railway Preview Environment . Railway automatically injects the `RAILWAY_GIT_BRANCH` environment variable, which you can pass directly to the `<TunnelToolbar />` component.

    ```jsx App.jsx
    import { TunnelToolbar } from '@tunnel/react';

    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          {(process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development" && process.env.RAILWAY_GIT_BRANCH !== "main") && (
            <TunnelToolbar
              projectId="PROJECT_ID"
              branch={process.env.RAILWAY_GIT_BRANCH}
            />
          )}
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

  </Tab>

    ### Install the Tunnel Next SDK

    <CodeGroup>
    ```shell npm
      npm install @tunnel/nextjs
    ```

    ```shell yarn
      yarn add @tunnel/nextjs
    ```

    ```shell pnpm
      pnpm add @tunnel/nextjs
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ### Add the `<TunnelToolbar />` component to your app

    To enable Tunnel in your app, conditionally Railway the `<TunnelToolbar />` component in your app. Developers usually only Railway the `<TunnelToolbar />` component in your app when it is running in a Railway Preview Environment environment.

    The `<TunnelToolbar />` component requires a `projectId` prop and a `branch` prop.

    - `projectId` is the ID of your Tunnel project. You can find your project ID in the [Tunnel Dashboard](https://tunnel.dev/redirect-to/default).
    - `branch` is the branch name of the Railway Preview Environment. Railway automatically injects the `RAILWAY_GIT_BRANCH` environment variable, which you can pass directly to the `<TunnelToolbar />` component.

    ```jsx layout.jsx
    import { TunnelToolbar } from '@tunnel/nextjs';

    export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body>
            {children}
            {(process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development" && process.env.RAILWAY_GIT_BRANCH !== "main") && (
              <TunnelToolbar
                projectId="PROJECT_ID"
                branch={process.env.RAILWAY_GIT_BRANCH}
              />
            )}
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }
    ```

    ### Add the `<script>` tag to your app

    To enable Tunnel in your app, add the `<script>` tag to your app. Developers usually only add the `<script>` tag in your app when it is running in a Railway Preview Environment environment.

    The `<script>` tag requires a `data-project-id` attribute and a `data-branch` attribute.

    - `data-project-id` is the ID of your Tunnel project. You can find your project ID in the [Tunnel Dashboard](https://tunnel.dev/).
    - `data-branch` is the branch name of the Railway Preview Environment. Railway automatically injects the `RAILWAY_GIT_BRANCH` environment variable, which you can pass directly to the `<script>` tag.

    ```html index.html
    <script
      src="https://tunnelapp.dev/__tunnel/script.js"
      data-project-id="PROJECT_ID"
      data-branch="RAILWAY_GIT_BRANCH"
    ></script>
    ```
