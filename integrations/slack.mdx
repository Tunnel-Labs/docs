## Overview
The Tunnel Slack integration allows you to link Slack channels to projects in Tunnel. Once linked, Tunnel will send a broadcast for each new comment in the linked Slack channel. This allows you to respond to feedback directly from Slack, with two-way synced threads and a resolve button to mark the comment as resolved.
## Configuration
### Connect Slack
Navigate to [**Settings** > **Integrations**](https://tunnel.dev/settings/integrations) and click **Connect**.
