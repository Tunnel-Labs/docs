## Overview

The Github integration allows you to link GitHub repositories to projects in Tunnel. Once linked, Tunnel will display the status of the comments on the corresponding branch. This allows you to see how many comments have been resolved and how many are still open.

## Configuration

### Connect Github

Navigate to [**Settings** > **Integrations**](https://tunnel.dev/settings/integrations) and click the **Connect** button.

## Adding git metadata to comments

### Development
The Tunnel CLI will automatically detect the repository and branch you are working on and add git metadata to comments.

### Staging and Production

To add git metadata to comments in your hosted environments, you will need to pass a git branch to the `<TunnelToolbar />` component or `<script>` tag.

<CodeGroup>

```jsx SDK
<TunnelToolbar projectId="PROJECT_ID" branch="BRANCH_NAME" />
```

```html <script> tag
<script
  src="https://tunnelapp.dev/__tunnel/script.js"
  data-project-id="PROJECT_ID"
  data-branch="BRANCH_NAME"
></script>
```

</CodeGroup>

## Sync Pull Requests

Pull requests receive generated PR messages from the Tunnel bot. The PR message tracks how many comments have been resolved and how many are still open. The PR message is updated every time a comment is resolved or reopened.
