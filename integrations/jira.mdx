<Info>
  The Jira integration connects via your Jira account, not your team's Jira
  organization, so you won't need an admin to use it.

If you have automatic issue creation turned on, you'll see the Jira icon at the bottom of comment box. You can click it to override your default settings and create an issue with custom properties. Otherwise, an issue will be created with your default settings when you submit the comment.
