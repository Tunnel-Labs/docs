Tunnel provides a [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tunnel.tunnel) that integrates your Tunnel with VSCode Live Share, allowing you to start a live share session from your Tunnel. Viewers of your Tunnel application will see a "Join Live Share" button on their pill, which they can use to easily join your Live Share session.

<Info>
If a viewer doesn't have VSCode installed, the "Join Live Share" button will open [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) in a new tab, making it possible for them to edit your codebase without needing to have VSCode installed.
