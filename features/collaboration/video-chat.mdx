To start a audio/video call inside a Tunnel, click the three dots on the pill and then click the "Start Video Call" button. This should open up a video bubble that displays which users are in the call, buttons to mute your microphone and hide your webcam, and a red exit button to leave the call.

You can interact with the video bubble by holding down the left mouse button on the bubble, which allows you to drag it to any corner of your screen. You can also hold down the middle mouse button on your video view, which allows you to pan your webcam's view to make sure your face is centered in the video.
