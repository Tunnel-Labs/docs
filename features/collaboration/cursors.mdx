On a Tunnel application, other viewers can see the position of your cursor in real-time. This makes it easy to point out certain parts of your website, or highlight text you want to emphasize.

<Info>
	The position of your cursor is relative to the website element it's hovered
	over, so it remains accurate across different screen sizes.
