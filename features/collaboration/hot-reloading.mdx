HMR (Hot-Module Replacement) is a feature offered by many modern web frameworks that allow a webpage to automatically update when the website code is changed. Tunnel integrates seamlessly with HMR provided by these frameworks, allowing viewers to see changes you make to your website in real-time.

<Info>
	Hot Reloading works with our [VSCode Live
	Share](/features/collaboration/vscode-live-share) integration, allowing
	editors in your Tunnel to instantly see their code changes applied to your
	website!
