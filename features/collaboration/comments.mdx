Viewers have the ability to leave comments oni specific parts of your Tunnel website. You can click on a comment to reply to it, or click the "Resolve" button to resolve it.

To create a comment, click the comment icon in the pill. Then, click on the section of the website you want to attach a comment to. You should then see a textbox, where you can input your feedback and suggestions that will be visible by all Tunnel viewers.

<Info>
A comment is anchored relative to the HTML element it is placed on, so it will display consistently across various screen sizes.
