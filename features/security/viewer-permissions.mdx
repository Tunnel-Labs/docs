Each Tunnel comes with fine-grained viewer permissions which you can use to restrict who is able to access your Tunnel. You can adjust these permissions from your Tunnel's dashboard, or by clicking the Share icon from your Tunnel's pill.

- 🌐︎ **Public:** Anyone with the link can view your Tunnel.
- 🏢 **Organization:** Anyone in your organization can view your Tunnel.
- 📧 **Email Invitation:** Only the users you invite by email can view your Tunnel.
- 🔒 **Private:** Only you can view your Tunnel.
