## Installing the CLI
First step - nice and easy. Install the Tunnel CLI.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -g @tunnel/cli
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add @tunnel/cli
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add --global @tunnel/cli
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication
Next, you have to login to the Tunnel CLI - you must have an account already. If you don't, [creating one](https://tunnel.dev/register) is pretty easy. 
<CodeBlock>tunnel login</CodeBlock>

## Creating a Tunnel
Now that you've installed the CLI and logged in, you can make your first tunnel! In order to do so, simply run the following command:

<CodeBlock>tunnel share</CodeBlock>

### Options
```
-p, --port          connect to a specific port
-o, --open          open the tunnel in your browser
```
